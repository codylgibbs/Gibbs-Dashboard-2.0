/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/build.gradle:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
    targetSdk 34
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdk specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdk is
   less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdk to the highest available value. Then
   test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:17: Warning: Attribute usesCleartextTraffic is only used in API level 23 and higher (current min is 21) [UnusedAttribute]
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedAttribute":
   This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a
   version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with
   the minSdkVersion attribute).

   This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
   However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality
   of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to
   achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can
   optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be
   used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer
   attribute.

   Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags
   can be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in
   API 21.

                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   your app really requires JavaScript support.

^

   Explanation for issues of type "MergeRootFrame":
   If a <FrameLayout> is the root of a layout and does not provide background
   or padding etc, it can often be replaced with a <merge> tag which is
   slightly more efficient. Note that this depends on context, so make sure
   you understand how the <merge> tag works before proceeding.

          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```

/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/app_icon.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]
/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/res/drawable/app_icon.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/res/drawable/app_icon.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/app_icon.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]
/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/res/drawable/app_icon2.png: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/app_icon2.png in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.

/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/res/drawable/app_icon2.png: Warning: The following unrelated icon files have identical contents: app_icon.png, app_icon2.png [IconDuplicates]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicates":
   If an icon is repeated under different names, you can consolidate and just
   use one of the icons and delete the others to make your application
   smaller. However, duplicated icons usually are not intentional and can
   sometimes point to icons that were accidentally overwritten or accidentally
   not updated.

/Users/codygibbs/Gibbs-Dashboard-2.0/android-tv/app/src/main/res: Warning: Missing density variation folders in src/main/res: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi, drawable-xxhdpi [IconMissingDensityFolder]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconMissingDensityFolder":
   Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major
   screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high).
   This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as
   drawable-hdpi.

   Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi
   density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable
   ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true. For more information on current density
   usage, see https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards
